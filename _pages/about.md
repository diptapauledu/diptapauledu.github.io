I am **Dipta Paul**, an Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate currently working in an operational and analytical engineering role, with strong research interests in **Machine Learning, Biomedical Engineering, and Intelligent Systems**.

My professional experience involves working with technical systems, operational monitoring, and analytical problem-solving, which has strengthened my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into real-world engineering applications. Alongside my professional role, I remain deeply engaged in academic research focused on data-driven modeling, medical signal analysis, intelligent decision support systems, and interdisciplinary engineering solutions.

I have experience in research documentation, manuscript preparation, and peer review for international journals and conferences. My work reflects a balance between **practical engineering exposure and research-oriented thinking**, enabling me to approach problems from both applied and analytical perspectives.

My long-term goal is to pursue **MSc and PhD studies** in a rigorous academic environment and contribute to impactful research at the intersection of engineering, data science, and healthcare technologies.

This website presents an overview of my academic background, professional experience, research interests, publications, and ongoing scholarly activities.
